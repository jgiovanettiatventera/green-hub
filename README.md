  4. Cross-Agency Comparisons
4. Implementation
  1. Enhancements to Existing Tableau
  2. [Python Notebook](development/GHG_project.ipynb)
  3. [Cross-Agency Tableau](development/Agency_Comparisons.twb)

## Results

1. Data Analysis via SQL
2. Explored Options within Tableu
  1. Modification in Tableu
  2. Long Term User Experience Improvements
  3. Additional Agency Ratings Dashboard
    a. Tableau
    b. Python

## Summary

Event without the Tableau background, our team worked to proved data solutions - from user and technical perspectives - that can be adapted for long term benefits to improve and track federal fleet greenhouse gase emissions.
