# Design


## UX Updates
The current Tableau report shows the breakdown of E85 vs regular gas vehicles per agency, with a few inputs to set a future state.  The new design attempts to utilize a more simpistic view of the entire set of vehicles (stacked graph) and allows the user to toggle the changes within the initial constraints of the existing (baseline).

This is an attempt at creating a more intuititive report for showing the current vs. target state for the fleet.

These are a guess at some of the inputs that would be required to generate this report

## Cross-Agency Comparisons
We think it might inspire competition and otherwise motivate each agency to improve if they could see how they stack up to the other agencies.
  
### How their individual vehicles are used (the GHG emitted per vehicle)
